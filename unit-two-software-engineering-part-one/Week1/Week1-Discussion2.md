## Software Engineering (Part One) - Week 1 - Discussion 2


### Write down three suggestions describing why or how software specifications might change.


#### Theres many reasons from different points of view.

- From a business point of view

	i. Estimations of development and testing is too high, therefore they need to replan what will be in scope for that piece of software.

	ii.  During Demo's or Showcases, stakeholder or customer may not be happy with the current implementation or functionality, therefore they may ask for changes.


- From an engineering point of view

	i. Designs and analysis may not be feasible for implementation or there may be conflicts in the ACs given, so that's when product or customers need to re-analyse and redesign the requirements.

	ii. As an example, a customer may want to include a dynamic and changeable hero images on their main page that conflicts with a overlaying button/toggle on image, during development,, developer sees that this does not look readable for the visually impaired or is not user friendly, so in this case developer would need to go back to analyst or business to point out this issue that needs change in design.
