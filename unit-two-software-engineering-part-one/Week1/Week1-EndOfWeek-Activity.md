## Software Engineering (Part One) - Week 1 - End of Week Activity


### Activity Task:

#### Consider the following scenarios:

- Air traffic control software for a small airport in Wales.

- A new first person shooter for a gaming console.

- A stock control system for a local bookstore.

- Statistics software to help scientists analyse their data.

#### For each of these, would you use the waterfall approach or the incremental approach? Explain why.


**Air traffic control software for a small airport in Wales.**

For this type of project I would say a waterfall approach should be ideally considered as it's scaled for a large and fast paced customers. It also requires safety protocols to be considered as it includes live traffic control in a busy environment, which is the main requirement of this.

**A new first person shooter for a gaming console**

I would definitely say incremental for this scenario as it requires different phases of testing, one would be testing in parallel during development, another would be E2E testing and finally releasing a trial version to customers to give initial feedback to engineering and business teams.

**A stock control system for a local bookstore**

This would make a good case for an incremental flow as the business is at a smaller scale, the customer will be able to give feedback on development as it happens. Automated tools can also be used to automate some of the features and components, this will require less testing.

**Statistics software to help scientists analyse their data**

A hybrid approach, will be suited for this (incremental and waterfall). As this software includes mathematical factors the requirements should be strictly defined and therefore are required to be documented, however as we're working with dynamic data, changes may be needed to the specifications and requirements, hence a level of flexibility may be needed. A prototype or trial version of this kind of software can also be released to customer/users in order to give some sort of feedback before final release.
