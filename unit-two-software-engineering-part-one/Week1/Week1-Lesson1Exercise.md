## Software Engineering (Part One) - Week 1 - Lesson 1 Exercise


### Consider these frequently asked questions by consumers of software:


#### Why does it take so long to develop software?

Due to the complexity of the Software requirements as well as tools and expertise required to implement the software. Software development requires functional and non functional testing which will add bugs and defects which the developer needs to fix. The software development lifecycle has many stages of that can be time consuming before it goes live.

#### Why does it cost so much?

It costs so much because there are many aspects involved such as; testing and fixing of bugs. There are also times where requirements change for the software in which it would be very costly. There is also the fact that certain software require specific systems to be developed and tested on, so developing on such systems is more complex and more costly at it requires different resources to develop and test the software.

#### Why do bugs make it into a released software?

There could be many factors to this such as; lack of unit testing in software, lack of automated and manual functional and behavioural testing. There's also the fact that there is rushed delivery and that itself reduces test effort and time which results in poor software quality.

#### Why do we need to maintain existing software?

Software dependencies and libraries could be updated and this may result in changes in software compatibility. Also maintaining code means allowing new developers to be able to make easy  changes when making changes to the software. There's also the fact that if the software is not maintained and refactored, software bugs and poor performance could increase.


#### Why do we struggle to measure the progress of software?

Because a software needs to be continuously developed, there are changes in requirement, added requirements as well as number of bugs raised and fixed. Something can be development complete, but there are other engineering dependencies such as quality assurance engineering that may alter the progress of a software.
